# Phosphom
An Automated Tool for PTM Visualization and Kinase Prediction to Guide Cell Signaling Research

Objective: Developed Phosphom, a rule-based automated tool designed to overcome bottlenecks in interpreting and visualizing phosphorylation (PTM) within aging research.
Functionality: Features an interpretable Regex framework for 11 aging-related kinases, supporting direct document mapping and streamlined data extraction.
Significance: Provides a scalable, user-friendly workflow that enhances—rather than replaces—expert biological interpretation in high-throughput proteomics.

Future Utility: Future updates will introduce adjustable kinase libraries that can be tailored to specific datasets, maximizing the tool's versatility across diverse proteomics research environments.
